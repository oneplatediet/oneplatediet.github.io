<h2 id="sec:x:1">1. Introduction</h2>
<p><span class="paraheader">The problem with diets is that diets don't work.</span>  The overwhelming
majority of dieters gain back all of the weight they lose within
a few years.  Over human history, rapid weight loss has generally been due to
scarcity of food, and the human body <q>helpfully</q> slows your metabolism
down to keep you from wasting away.  The more you diet, the
more your metabolism slows, and the harder it is to not gain weight.</p>
<p><span class="paraheader">The only <q>diet</q> that can work is not a diet, but a <q>lifestyle
change</q>.</span>  The word <q>diet</q> suggests a temporary state of being,
something you do for a little while until you hit your target weight.
But what really determines your long-term weight is how you live
in the years and years <em>after</em> the diet.   And since dieting
is counterproductive, we should skip that part and go directly
to living our life the way we should.</p>
<p><span class="paraheader">Slow weight loss over a long time = success!</span>  The key to
prevent your body from sabotaging your weight loss is by
losing weight <em>slowly</em>.  When you lose weight slowly, your
body doesn't think it's in danger and won't slow your metabolism much.
That's why <q>lifestyle changes</q> are so much more effective than <q>diets</q>.
Slow weight loss over long periods of time can really add up: If you
lose half a pound a week for a year, that's 26 pounds!</p>
<p><span class="paraheader">If we're going to do something for years and years, it
better be damn easy.</span>  There's no way a person can follow a diet
for a long time if it's a pain in the ass.  The fact is that
most people are not willing to spend the effort to
eat five servings of vegetables a day or avoid all carbs or always
order salads at restaurants.  And spending even
five minutes after every meal logging what you ate can drive a person
batty in no time.</p>
<h2 id="sec:x:2">2. The Rules</h2>
<p>OK, here's the <q>One Plate Diet</q> (though it's not really a diet
but a lifestyle change):
<ul><li>
<p>For every meal of the day, pick a plate that you will use
every day, i.e., a <q>breakfast</q> plate, a <q>lunch</q> plate, and
a <q>dinner</q> plate.  Picture how much food you usually eat at
that meal, then choose a plate that's slightly smaller.</p>
</li><li>
<p>At each meal, you can fill your plate once <q>for free</q>.  If
you want more, you can fill your plate again, but <em>before</em> you
do, <strong>you must write down that you did in a monthly log</strong>.  This
log can be as simple as a piece of paper; just write down
the date and meal and track how many extra plates you ate.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Buy a good digital scale and weigh yourself every day at the same time
wearing the same amount of clothes.
At the end of the week, pick the lowest weight from the week and that
is your official weight for that week.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Adjust your plate sizes until you are losing about half a pound
a week.  If you are not losing weight, pick a slightly
smaller plate size for some meals until you are.</p>
</li></ul>
</p>
<h2 id="sec:x:3">3. Where's the Part Telling Me What Foods I Can and Can't Eat?</h2>
<p><span class="paraheader">People can't always choose what they eat.</span>  It can take
time and effort to eat healthy.  Or you may be part of a family
and not be in charge of what gets served.  Ultimately, a lifestyle
change is pointless if it's too much bother to follow, and
only <em>you</em> can determine what <em>you</em> are willing to eat.</p>
<p><span class="paraheader">Eat healthy if you can.</span>  I'm not saying you shouldn't <em>try</em>
to eat healthy.  Unfortunately, there doesn't always seem to be wide
agreement about what this means.  It's probably pretty safe to
eat lots of fruits and vegetables and to avoid eating
lots of added sugar or highly-refined carbs.</p>
<h2 id="sec:x:4">4. Where's the Part Telling Me How Much Exercise I Need to Get?</h2>
<p>Exercise has tons and tons of health benefits, and you should do it.
Unfortunately, it hasn't consistently been shown to be helpful
in losing weight.</p>
<h2 id="sec:x:5">5. Why This Diet Works I: The Beauty of One Plate</h2>
<p>There are two key principles that form the backbone of this diet:
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Measurement</strong> — Obviously, you need to weigh yourself to know
if you're losing weight.  But you also need to measure how much
food you're eating, to know if you're eating <em>less</em>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Sustainability/Simplicity</strong> — A diet isn't sustainable unless
it's incredibly simple.</p>
</li></ul>
What a <q>plate</q> represents is the simplest possible way to measure
how much you're eating.  Having a simple measuring device prevents you
from continuing to eat just because you have no idea how much
you've already eaten.  While <em>what</em> you're eating matters too,
recording this is work and it can affect weight loss in unpredictable
ways.</p>
<p><span class="paraheader">Why It Doesn't Matter What You Eat.</span>  The reason it doesn't
matter is because we use <em>feedback</em>.  If you are not losing weight,
just eat less.  The important thing is to be consistent in
the types of food you eat.  If you eat all salad one week and
find you are losing weight, then eating all ice cream the next week
may not produce the same results.</p>
<h2 id="sec:x:6">6. Why This Diet Works II: The Monthly Log</h2>
<p><span class="paraheader">I can eat as many plates as I want as long as I log it!?</span>
Look, the assumption here is that you want to lose weight more than
you enjoy overeating.  If whenever something slightly tasty is
placed in front of you, you think, <q>I'm eating this; damn the
consequences!</q>, then this diet (and every other diet) will
not work for you.</p>
<p><span class="paraheader">The only <q>punishment</q> for eating an extra plate is writing
it down!?</span>  When you break the rules of a diet, the only
one who can punish you is yourself.  If the punishment
is too harsh, you'll stop following the diet.
Ultimately, we rely on your desire to succeed to supply
all the negative or positive feedback that is required.
If you stick to one plate, you'll feel good about yourself.
If you eat an extra plate for no good reason, you'll
be disappointed and that will be punishment enough.</p>
<p><span class="paraheader">Creating a good habit.</span>  The point of the logging is to
create a habit: Whenever you get another plate of food, you
<em>think</em> about whether you really want it.  It's perfectly
fine to eat more sometimes (you're starving; impressing your
boss; etc.), but the danger is eating more when you don't
really need or want to.  Writing something down forces
you to pause and think about it, but it's not so painful
as to make it hard to stick to the diet.</p>
<h2 id="sec:x:7">7. FAQ</h2>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Is this really a diet?</strong> — No, it's a lifestyle change, but
calling it <q>The One Plate Lifestyle Change</q> sounds a lot worse.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>What about snacks?</strong> — You can eat snacks if you're hungry.  Just
pick an appropriately sized snack plate, and be consistent about
how many snacks you eat each day.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>What about soup?  You can't put soup on a plate!</strong> — Put the
soup in a bowl and put the bowl on the plate.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>What if I don't have my plates with me?</strong> — Find a bigger plate
and use ketchup to draw the outline of your plate on top.  Or just
do this in your head.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>What if my meal comes in multiple courses?</strong> — Remember in
your head what fraction of a plate you've already eaten.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>What if I pile on food as high as I can?</strong> — Then the diet won't
work unless you use really small plates.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Did you forget the step about reviewing the monthly logs?</strong> —
No, not really.  It can be informative to look at the monthly
logs to try to spot trends, e.g., particular times you tend to overeat.
But the real reason for logging is to make it a habit to think
every time you get another plate.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Is there an app I can use for the monthly logs?</strong> —
Any note-taking app should work, like <em>Notes</em> for iOS.  Or you
can print out monthly calendar pages, or just use a blank piece of paper.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>What if I'm hungry all the time?</strong>  — It may be the case that
when you make your plates small enough to lose weight, you are
hungry all the time.  If so, this diet probably won't work
for you unless you have an exceptional amount of self-discipline.
However, for most people, this shouldn't be the case, because
the human body is amazing.  The human body can comfortably adapt
to a wide range of situations, and gradual weight loss should
generally not cause a great deal of suffering.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Do I really need a <q>breakfast</q> plate?</strong> — I didn't use one.  If
you always eat the same amount for breakfast, there's no need.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>I have different plates for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Why
isn't it called <q>The Three Plate Diet</q>?</strong> — I used the same
plate for lunch and dinner and no plate for breakfast, so it really
was only one plate for me.  More importantly, the <q>one</q> refers
to <em>one</em> plate of food per meal.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Why do I need to weigh myself every day?</strong> — <em>Gradual</em> weight
loss is crucial, and this can be hard to
measure since a person's weight varies throughout the day and
between days.  Taking the minimum weight over seven days
should result in a more accurate weight measurement.  Taking the
average would be better, but people hate math.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Are you a nutrition expert?</strong> — No, I'm just a guy who
wanted to lose some weight and who likes to read a lot.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Are you a shill for <q>Big Plate</q>?</strong> — There is no
such thing as <q>Big Plate</q>.  And this site has no ads and
never will.</p>
